# The Road to 皆伝

I think it would be interesting to track my IIDX progress, so I’ve decided to create this space. I will record
accomplishments and thoughts about the game as I continue my lengthy journey. - 2013-01-10

<h3>Patterns, Techniques, &amp; Comments</h3>

<hr><h4>Notes</h4>

<p>I’ve never played a game with falling or rising notes. The only other rhythm game I’ve played is Technika, and before that I’ve never played any. With IIDX, it’s very much like learning to touch type. The most frustrating thing is attempting to hit a key and missing it completely. While the concept is simple, it took a while for me to get comfortable.</p>

<p>2013-10-06: When I started playing doubles, I went through the frustration of physically missing the keys once again. I’m pretty decent with doubles now and it’s so much fun. It’s like an entirely new game.</p>

<h4>Chords</h4>

<ul><li>Double</li>
<li>Triple</li>
<li>More</li>
</ul><h4>Alternating</h4>

<p>This is a pretty simple left-right repeating pattern that gets harder as the speed increases. When the speed reaches a certain point, I start to hit the notes together as if they were chords. It’s somewhat difficult to recover from once I lose my timing. e.g. RISLIM [H]</p>

<h4>Jacks</h4>

<p>I have no problems with jacks unless they come in rapid successions. When that happens I lose my rhythm completely. Jacks become extremely difficult if an adjacent key exists somewhere in the middle. e.g. THE EARTH LIGHT [H]</p>

<h4>Scales</h4>

<ul><li>Half</li>
<li>Full</li>
<li>Rolling</li>
<li>Rolling Disjoint</li>
<li>Jagged</li>
<li>Mixed</li>
</ul><h4>Streams</h4>

<h4>Clusters</h4>

<h4>Thumbs</h4>

<p>I’ve always used my thumbs and never had any problems. I actually found it surprising that people have trouble because it came so naturally since day one. I use them just as much, if not more, than any other finger.</p>

<h4>Sliding</h4>

<p>I find myself doing this more as I dive deeper into level 9. There are certain patterns in which I will almost always slide. For example, I play on the right side, so when a 5+S chord comes down followed immediately by a 7 note, I will hit 5+S with one hand, the 5 with my thumb, and then hit the 7 by sliding my thumb from the 5.</p>

<h4>Pinky Scratch</h4>

<p>When I first started, several people have mentioned this and have said I should learn this technique. I just ignored that advice and did whatever I felt was comfortable. As I got better and started playing more note heavy charts, I found myself doing this naturally. So, my thoughts on the pinky scratch is that it isn’t something you really learn, it’s something you eventually end up doing (it’s this or wrist/forearm scratching) because there’s just no way to hit a scratch if you take your hand off the main keys when a ton of notes are coming at you at the same time.</p>

<h4>Crossover</h4>

<p>This is when you use your left hand for 5, 6, 7, or your right hand for 1, 2, 3. I noticed doing this on a few occasions when I started my journey into level 9; especially during extremely heavy note bombardments. I believe this is something that’s necessary if I want to conquer the later levels, and I also believe playing doubles will really help me here.</p>

<h4>Recovery</h4>

<p>This is the time it takes to get back on track after messing up. It’s something I got better at over time. Notes come down relentlessly, and I took forever to recover when I first began. On fast charts this was very bad because my gauge would just drain instantly.</p>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>Recognizing the spacing between each note is pretty important, in my opinion, but I’ve never heard anyone mention it. Recognizing the vertical spacing between two notes helps me get a better feel of how fast or slow I have to hit them, and recognizing the horizontal spacing gives me a better sense of which keys I have to press. After a while, the spacing of particular patterns become very noticeable and I begin to treat them as a single set rather than a collection of individual notes. This is extremely helpful because it means I see a shape coming down rather than a potentially confusing series of notes.</p>

<h4>Timing</h4>

<p>The only way to improve timing is to improve comfort level for various charts and patterns. The less concentration is wasted on reading notes, the more of it can be focused on hitting them. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that just because you’re comfortable with a chart or pattern that you should be getting AAAs. Timing is hard and very often it will just come down to grinding.</p>

<h4>Improvement</h4>

<p>Often, I would reach a point where it would appear as if I’m not improving. This is actually an illusion. Although I may not be able to clear new charts, I find a lot of the previously cleared charts to be easier; indicated either by a lower miss count, better score, or being able to clear it on a harder gauge. I’ve decided, then, to adopt a Play All Pass All method of improving. I would play something in a particular level folder, and move on regardless of whether I clear it. Once I’ve played everything, I’d go to the next level folder. This process continues until I feel the level I’m playing is too much for me, in which case I would go back to earlier levels and try to clear what I’ve failed. It’s a very slow and rigorous process, but I believe it will make me a much better player overall.</p>

<h4>Random</h4>

<p>Continuously playing charts that have already been cleared will result in little progress, if any; even on random. I don’t think random helps because the rhythm remains the same. Most people suggest random as a means to get exposure to new patterns. Well, the best way to do that is to just play other charts. If you’ve already cleared a chart or all charts have been play, then by all means use random. However, almost always, I find people using random simply as an attempt to clear a chart they’re normally unable to clear, not as a method of improvement.</p>

<h4>What level am I?</h4>

<p>I don’t like to say I’m on a certain level until I can clear a vast majority of a previous level. My standard is clearing 80% of all charts of one level before saying I’m on the next level. I also believe trying to clear higher levels as fast as possible is a detriment because it would be too easy to neglect a large number of charts and patterns.</p>

<p>2013-10-06: I feel I may have to revise this. By this definition I can say that I’m on 10s, but I haven’t been able to clear many. In fact, I’ve fail the vast majority of 10s I’ve attempted. I’m considering a new method that uses the folder grade that Tricoro introduced. There is an info box on the left side during song selection that shows your total DJ Points for a selected folder. These points determine your grade for that folder. I’m thinking I should now say I’m only on a level if I can get an A on the previous level. The folder grade also counts songs you haven’t played, so you really have to play everything in a folder to get an accurate representation of your skill. That’s the only downside.</p>

<h4>Walls</h4>

<p>Don’t climb over a wall, walk around it. That means don’t try to grind a song until you can clear it, go to something else. Expose yourself to new patterns. If you can’t find anything new to clear, go back and play something on a harder gauge. Being able to beat a chart on a harder gauge is proof that you’re comfortable with the patterns.</p>
